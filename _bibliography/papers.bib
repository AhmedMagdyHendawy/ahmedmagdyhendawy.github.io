  title={Material Identification using MIMO Radars in Non-contact Dynamical Environments},
  abstract={Identifying the material type of objects is one of the assets for a robust autonomous system.
            This can be exemplified by an autonomous vehicle changes its speed given the material of the
            ground, a robot vacuum switches between different operating modes based on the type of the
            floor, or a rescuing robot detects the existence of humans under building debris. Computer
            Vision (CV) is succeeding to outperform its peers in many real-life challenges. Although
            Convolution Neural Network (CNN) achieves outstanding performance for material classi-
            fication given images, it is limited to suitable lightening conditions, distinguishable object
            textures, and unblocked objects. Given those limitations, images are no longer the appropri-
            ate input for material classification. On the other hand, recent works utilize the Intermediate
            Frequency (IF) radar signals for material classification to tackle the former limitations. The
            IF signals are high variance in their nature as a result of many factors like oscillation or rela-
            tive distance of the object in front of the radar. Different preprocessing techniques have been
            used for having robust and low variant data fed to a Neural Network (NN) model. However, a
            noticeable delay arises during inference. Therefore, we propose a radar-based material clas-
            sifier which deals with IF signals yet is robust against its high variance. Moreover, former
            works succeed in classifying various material types using the IF signals. However, the classi-
            fication setting requires the object to be in contact with the radar. The burden of non-contact
            classification has never been tackled by any former Deep Learning (DL) work. Accordingly,
            a new learning setting is proposed to map the high variant non-contact input domain to a low
            variant input domain as in the contact case. This approach treats the effect of the distance as
            a noise that can be denoised by an appropriate architecture. A modified version of WaveNet
            is adopted as our denoising architecture. As a result, a low intra-variance manifold of each
            class is formed, which can be easily classified using a shallow NN. Since a public radar-based
            dataset for material classification is not available for training and evaluation. To have a well-
            defined benchmark, we present a radar-based material classification dataset collected using a
            24 GHz Millimeter-wave (mmWave) radar. Since this is the first work to tackle the material
            classification problem in the non-contact case, we lack a former work to compare against.
            Thus, we adopt a well-known image classification family, ResNet [1] to be our baseline. Our
            approach outperforms the classification baseline in terms of test accuracy. In addition, robust
            performance is shown in a real-life scenario.},

  title={A Hybrid Approach for Constrained Deep Reinforcement Learning},
  abstract={Recently, deep reinforcement learning techniques have achieved tangible results for
            learning high dimensional control tasks. Due to the trial and error interaction be-
            tween the autonomous agent and the environment, the learning phase is uncon-
            strained and limited to the simulator. Such exploration has an additional drawback
            of consuming unnecessary samples at the beginning of the learning process. Model-
            based algorithms, on the other hand, handle this issue by learning the dynamics
            of the environment. However, model-free algorithms have a higher asymptotic per-
            formance than the model-based one. Our contribution is to construct a hybrid
            structured algorithm, that makes use of the benefits of both methods, to satisfy
            constraint conditions throughout the learning process. We demonstrate the valid-
            ity of our approach by learning a reachability task. The results show complete
            satisfaction for the constraint condition, represented by a static obstacle, with less
            number of samples and higher performance compared to state-of-the-art model-free
            algorithms.},
