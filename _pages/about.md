I am a third-year PhD. student at the LiteRL and IAS research groups at TU Darmstadt, Germany. My advisors are Prof. Carlo Dâ€™Eramo and Prof. Jan Peters. I have a master's degree in Information Technology from the University of Stuttgart, with a specialization in Computer Engineering. In 2019, I graduated from the German University in Cairo (GUC) with a bachelor's degree in Mechatronics Engineering. 

My research delves into the Reinforcement Learning topics of multi-task and continual learning. My research objective is to boost the learning process of agents by leveraging knowledge from multiple tasks learned concurrently or in sequence. I develop RL algorithms that are application agnostic; however, I lean towards robot learning applications.
